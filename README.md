After I created a new project from the android studio and added all the links needed for the firebase. It is showing an error to connect with my firebase.

Steps:

1.  Open the app from Android studio
2.  Try to complete the sync gradle.
3.  Tap on the “Tools"
4.  Tap on the “firebase” 
5.  Expand the “Authentication” option from the firebase window.
6.  Tap on “Authenticate using Google Sign-In” or “Authenticate using a custom authentication system [Kotlin]”
7.  Tap on “ 1. Connect to Firebase”

Result: 
Showing a Connect to Firebase dialog box with “Could not parse the Android Application Module's Gradle config. Resolve gradle build issues and/or resync.” message.
